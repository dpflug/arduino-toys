* My Arduino Toys

** blinks
This is just me playing with blinking. On the Digispark, the LED's on an analog pin, so I can simulate a breathing LED. Yay!

I also created a timing array and a procedure to take that and blink through the timings.

** blinks2
Simpler blinking. I don't remember why I made this, now.
